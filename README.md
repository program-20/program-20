Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gilbert, a data scientist and machine learning engineer passionate about using data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems. With a background in computer science and a keen interest in statistics, I enjoy working on projects that require a combination of programming, mathematics, and domain expertise.

What I do
As a data scientist and machine learning engineer, I'm involved in every stage of the data science pipeline, from data collection and cleaning to model development and deployment. I have experience working with a variety of data sources, including structured, unstructured, and time-series data, and have used a range of tools and technologies to extract insights from data, including Python, R, SQL, and NoSQL databases.

My interests
I'm particularly interested in using machine learning techniques to solve problems in healthcare, finance, and social impact. I enjoy exploring new datasets, experimenting with different models, and evaluating the impact of my work on real-world outcomes. I also believe in the power of open-source and enjoy contributing to the wider data science community through code, blog posts, and discussions.

How to reach me
If you'd like to chat about data science, machine learning, or anything related, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always happy to collaborate and learn from others in the community.
